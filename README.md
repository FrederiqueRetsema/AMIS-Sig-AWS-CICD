# AMIS-Sig-AWS-CICD

This repository is used for the SIG (Special Interest Group) about Amazon AWS and CI/CD.

If you want to do the SIG yourself, in your own environment, at home - then go to the
vagrant directory. Read the README.md file how to set it up. The description of what to
do can be found in this (main) directory of the repository.

Have fun!
